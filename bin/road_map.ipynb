    "The next major addition was the coronatine synthesis pathway, which was performed in cor_addition.ipynb. This went two ways: the first attempt was to add each of the reactions independantly that were laid out in https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.26.15469 . This is a putative pathway, but the most worked out one to date. However due to issues of mass balance in ACP, I collapsed the pathway to more reflect the basic syntehsis posed in Pseudomonas syringae Phytotoxins: Mode of Action, Regulation, and Biosynthesis by Peptide and Polyketide Synthetases (no doi presented)."

This is done through the notebook concise_gapfill.ipynb, which is a part of the gapfilling protocol. So, even though it is embedded in the gapfilling protocol, this will not change teh outcome bcause it is drawing from the same source everytime. There is no additional model based with the actual biomass equation, however, using the adapted version of the gapfilling protocol, I have generated PSTv7 with the new biomass equation."
