    "First, we'll curate a few reactions from the previous round that we finished curating after starting the second round of ensemble generation. The first is rxn01423, L-2-aminoadipate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. There is evidence that this exists in Pseudomonas putida (doi: 10.1128/JB.187.21.7500â€“7510.2005); there are two candidates that match in the P. syringae sv. tomato DC3000 genome, PSPTO_4775 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q87W08) and PSPTO_5504 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q87U11). Both are GntR transcriptional regulators that also have aminotransferase activity (MocR family, which transfers amino groups to keto-acid receptors), there is significant sequence similarity to a Pseudomonas florescens 2-aminoadipate aminotransferase (Uniprot accession P florescens: A0A0K1QLZ8). BLAST of the two putative P. syringae sv tomato DC3000 genes suggests the aminotransferase domain is conserved, but the proteins are ~100AA different in length. We hypothesize that a duplication event led to insertion of the aminotransferase in a transcription factor gene, so we will add both genes within an OR relationship for this reaction."
